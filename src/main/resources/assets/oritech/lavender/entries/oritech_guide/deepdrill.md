<block;oritech:deep_drill_block[machine_assembled=true]>
The bedrock extractor can mine ores from below bedrock at places where ore resource nodes are found. The multiblock machine can only operate when placed on resource nodes, and
must be powered using enderic lasers.

**Resource Nodes**

<block;oritech:resource_node_nickel>

Resource nodes are spawned naturally throughout the world. The appear in clusters just on top of the bedrock layer. There's resource nodes for all ore types 
in the overworld. They are usually covered by a small pocket of water or oil on top.

;;;;;

On the surface, the location of a resource node cluster can be identified by the occurrence of an ore boulder. The ore boulder also identifies the type of ores found in the cluster.

;;;;;

When in operation, the extracted ore will be of the type that the resource node below the middle of the machine is. This is important to keep in mind when placing the machine.

As the bedrock extractor is 3x3x3 in size, you'll have to place it one block in front of the target resource node.
