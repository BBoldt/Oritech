All oritech machines require energy to operate. Items can be automatically inserted to the input slots from the top, front, left and back side. This also applies
to multiblocks and cannot be changed. Result slots can be accessed from the bottom and right side.

The items contained in a machine will always be dropped when the machine is destroyed, while the energy and fluids contained will be lost. Machines can be broken using a pickaxe.
There's no need for a special wrench or anything similar.
