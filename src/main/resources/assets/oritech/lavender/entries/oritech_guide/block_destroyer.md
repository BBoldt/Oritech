<block;oritech:destroyer_block[machine_assembled=true]>

The block destroyer is used to, as you guessed it, destroy blocks. It's a multi-block that operates on a machine frame, and targets the block layer directly below the frame.

;;;;;

The time and energy it takes to break a block is based on the blocks' hardness. The block destroyer tries to destroy all blocks below. To allow a farming usage, the crop filter addon can be installed.
This will cause the block destroyer to skip all non-finished crops.
